# Advent of Code 2017

After solving [AoC 2015 in Nim](https://github.com/narimiran/advent_of_code_2015), and [AoC 2016 in Python](https://github.com/narimiran/advent_of_code_2016), for 2017 I'll try to solve [Advent of Code puzzles](http://adventofcode.com/2017/) in both [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and Python.

My aim is to provide clean and readable, yet idiomatic, solutions in both languages. If you have any comment/suggestion/advice, please let me know!
